BakingApp

App allows user to select a apiRecipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it

App description: 
Productionizing the app means, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. 
This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, 
adding a widget, and adding a library.
Task was to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, 
to share her apiRecipe with the world. App allows a user to select a apiRecipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.
